# fuzzySim
Fuzzy Similarity in Species Distributions

`fuzzySim` can convert binary presence-absence to fuzzy occurrence data, using e.g. trend surface analysis, inverse distance interpolation or prevalence-independent environmental favourability modelling, for one or more species simultaneously.

It can then calculate e.g. fuzzy change and fuzzy similarity among (fuzzy) species distributions and/or among (fuzzy) regional species compositions, avoiding the use of thresholds and instead using fuzzy logic versions of known similarity indices.

# install the latest version:
'fuzzySim' was created long before I knew GitHub, and it's still maintained on its original platform, [R-Forge](https://fuzzysim.r-forge.r-project.org/). So, you can install the development version with:

`install.packages("fuzzySim", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")`

The package is also on CRAN, but the development version (above) often includes recent enhancements and small bug fixes.
